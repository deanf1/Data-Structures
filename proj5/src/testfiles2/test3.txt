Meanwhile, anger and irritation over the incident and the police response to it continued to grow ahead of a major rally that organizers vowed would "shut this city down on Saturday."

"The people are demanding immediate arrests, immediate end to the protracted investigation, and immediate end to the stonewalling," said Malik Shabazz, president of Black Lawyers for Justice.

But he and other officials vowed the protests would be peaceful -- much as they were Thursday night, despite a few scuffles and two detentions.
